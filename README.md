The Hospital Management System is a Qt-based C++ application for managing patients, staff, billing, and medication logistics across a network of hospitals. It offers a clean tabbed interface for efficient hospital administration, supporting tasks like patient tracking, doctor/nurse assignment, billing, and pharmacy coordination.

## Required File Structure
If you're having issues with missing files or resources, ensure your project has the following structure:

```
HospitalManagementSystem/
├── HospitalManagementSystem.pro    # Qt project file
├── *.cpp                           # C++ implementation files
├── *.h                             # C++ header files
├── images/                         # Directory containing images
│   └── hospital_icon.png           # Application icon
├── resources.qrc                   # Qt resource file
└── README.md                       # This documentation
```

---

## Verifying Qt Installation
To verify that Qt is correctly installed and accessible:

### Windows
```bash
qmake --version
```

### macOS/Linux
```bash
qmake --version
which qmake
```

If these commands don't return a Qt version or path, your Qt installation might not be in your PATH.

---

## System Architecture

The system follows the Model-View-Controller (MVC) pattern:

- **Model**: Core logic in C++ classes like `Hospital`, `Patient`, `Doctor`, `Nurse`, `Pharmacy`, and `Drug`
- **View & Controller**: Qt-based GUI (`MainWindow`) with a tabbed interface
- **Controllers**: Singleton managers `HospitalSystem` and `PharmacySystem` coordinate global operations

---

### Core OOP Principles
- **Encapsulation**: All class attributes are private, accessed via getters/setters (e.g., `getDoctorID()`, `getHospitalID()`).
- **Composition**: Hospitals manage collections of `Patient`, `Doctor`, and `Nurse` objects; `Pharmacy` manages `Drug` and `Bill` objects.
- **Modular Classes**: Each class (e.g., `Patient`, `Doctor`, `Hospital`, `Pharmacy`) has a focused responsibility and minimal dependencies.
- **Singleton Pattern**: `HospitalSystem` and `PharmacySystem` are global managers used to coordinate application-wide logic from any part of the code.

## Technical Documentation

### Class Structure
Our application is built around the following key classes:

#### Core Classes
- **Hospital**: Manages a collection of patients, doctors, and nurses at a specific location
- **Patient**: Stores patient information, medical history, and billing data
- **Doctor**: Manages doctor information and patient assignments
- **Nurse**: Handles nurse information and patient assignments

#### Management Classes
- **HospitalSystem**: Singleton manager coordinating hospitals, staff, and patient assignments
- **PharmacySystem**: Singleton manager for all pharmacy and medication operations

#### Support Classes
- **Drug**: Data structure for medication information
- **Pharmacy**: Manages medication inventory and billing for hospitals
- **Bill**: Tracks financial transactions between hospitals and pharmacies

### Data Flow
1. User actions in the GUI trigger methods in the `MainWindow` class
2. `MainWindow` communicates with the singleton managers (`HospitalSystem` and `PharmacySystem`)
3. The managers coordinate operations across multiple entities (hospitals, pharmacies)
4. Results are returned to the GUI for display

### Database Structure
The system uses in-memory data structures rather than a persistent database. All system state is initialized at startup and lost when the application exits.

---

## System Requirements and Constraints

### Operational Requirements
- Maximum 20 patients per hospital (100 patients total across all 5 hospitals)
- Minimum 3 doctors per hospital
- Minimum 5 nurses per hospital
- Maximum 50 doctors in the entire system
- Maximum 60 nurses in the entire system
- Maximum 2 patients assigned per nurse
- Each patient can have multiple attending doctors but only one primary doctor
- Patients can only be discharged by a doctor

---

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### Application Crashes on Startup
- Ensure Qt libraries are correctly installed and accessible
- Check that required Qt modules are available

#### Cannot Add New Patient
- Verify the hospital has fewer than 20 patients
- Ensure the provided doctor and nurse work at the selected hospital
- Verify that the nurse is not already assigned to 2 patients and that we only allow 60 nurses in the system
- There are multiple doctors but there is a limit to a total of 50 doctors such that each doctor has a unique ID and there is a minimum of 3 doctors in each of the five hospitals.

#### Cannot Relocate Staff
- Staff with assigned patients cannot be relocated
- Hospitals must maintain minimum staffing levels (3 doctors, 3 nurses)

#### Payment Issues
- Payment amount cannot exceed the remaining balance
- Patient ID must exist in the system
- Patients must be in an active (non-discharged) state

## Future Development

Planned features for future releases:

- **Persistent Storage**: Database integration to preserve system state between sessions
- **Authentication System**: Role-based access control for different user types
- **Advanced Reporting**: Export financial and operational reports to PDF/CSV
- **Mobile Companion App**: Allow staff to access the system on mobile devices
- **Patient Portal**: Self-service interface for patients to view their information

## Project Requirements and Implementation

### Original Requirements

**Hospitals**: Five different hospital locations, each able to handle 20 patient admissions (100 total). Patients can be admitted to any location or relocated as needed.

**Pharmacies**: 20 pharmacies with individual identifications that can be contacted by any hospital for prescription drug delivery, with direct billing to hospitals.

**Patients**: Each patient receives a unique Patient ID on admission, with personal details, contact information, disease, and treatment information recorded. Patients are billed based on days admitted and remain until discharged by a doctor.

**Doctors**: Maximum of 50 doctors (each with a unique ID), with a minimum of 3 doctors per hospital. Doctors can treat multiple patients, and patients can have multiple attending doctors but only one primary doctor.

**Nurses**: Maximum of 60 nurses (each with a unique ID), with a minimum of 5 nurses per hospital. Each nurse can care for at most 2 patients.

### How We Met These Requirements

1. **Hospital Network Implementation**:
   - Created 5 distinct hospital locations with unique IDs and names
   - Each hospital enforces a 20-patient capacity limit (100 patients total)
   - Implemented patient relocation functionality between hospitals
   - Each hospital maintains its own staff and patient records

2. **Pharmacy System**:
   - Implemented 20 unique pharmacies with individual IDs and names
   - Created a drug delivery system connecting hospitals to pharmacies
   - Built billing functionality that tracks hospital-pharmacy financial transactions

3. **Patient Management**:
   - Developed comprehensive patient tracking with unique IDs
   - Implemented admission, relocation, and discharge workflows
   - Created a daily billing system based on length of stay
   - Enabled doctor-authorized discharge process

4. **Doctor Management**:
   - Created system with maximum 50 doctors across all hospitals
   - Enforced minimum 3 doctors per hospital constraint
   - Implemented primary doctor assignment system
   - Built doctor-patient relationship tracking

5. **Nurse Management**:
   - Implemented system with maximum 60 nurses across all hospitals
   - Enforced minimum 5 nurses per hospital constraint (as specified in the requirements)
   - Limited each nurse to maximum 2 patient assignments
   - Created nurse-patient assignment tracking

All these requirements were implemented using object-oriented programming principles, with classes for each entity type (Hospital, Patient, Doctor, Nurse, Pharmacy), centralized management through singleton pattern managers (HospitalSystem, PharmacySystem), and a Qt-based user interface for intuitive interaction with the system.
