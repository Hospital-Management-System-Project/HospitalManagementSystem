## System Architecture

The system is designed using the Model-View-Controller (MVC) pattern:

- **Model**: Core C++ classes (`Hospital`, `Patient`, `Doctor`, `Nurse`, `Pharmacy`)
- **View & Controller**: Qt-based GUI using `MainWindow` and tabbed navigation
- **Controllers**: Singleton managers (`HospitalSystem`, `PharmacySystem`) coordinate logic
